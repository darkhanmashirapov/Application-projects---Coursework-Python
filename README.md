# Darkhan Mashirapov's Programming Projects Repository

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains a collection of my **Machine Learning**, **Python programming**, and **SQL projects**, including a final project where I predict stock prices using neural networks.  

## Repository Structure

- **Machine_Learning_Projects/**  
  Contains projects where I explore different machine learning algorithms, classification, and clustering.

- **Python_Programming_Projects/**  
  Includes Python projects focusing on programming skills, algorithms, including regression and data manipulation.

- **Final_Project_Stock_Prediction/**  
  My final project where I predict stock prices using neural networks.

- **SQL_Data_and_Movie_Dataset/**  
  Projects involving SQL operations and data visualization using a movie dataset. Includes:
  - `data/` – Movie datasets
  - `notebooks/` – SQL queries and visualization analysis

## Key Highlights

- Implementation of classic machine learning algorithms such as **KNN, Perceptron, Linear Regression, and Neural Networks, Logistics Regression etc.**.
- SQL data analysis and visualization projects for practical data insights.
- Final project uses **deep learning techniques** to predict stock prices.
- Well-documented notebooks and code for easy understanding and reproducibility.

*Please note that, final neural network project was done within a group
